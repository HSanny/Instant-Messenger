# Instant-Messenger
Used a modified UART communication protocol to send instant messages and audio between two FPGA boards in assembly. 
This uses the NIOSII processor on the altera monitor program.
Tools needed: two DE1SOC boards, two monitors using VGA, two microphones, two keyboards, and two mice.
Two GPIO cables should connect between the two FPGAs using the ring network topology.
